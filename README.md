# Ray Tracer

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ray-Tracer made by Manuel Rodr√≠guez Matesanz and Micah Paul Davis for our Computer Graphics work in C++.
It uses some demo scenes with regular OpenGL and our developed Ray-Tracer. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default the scene will load in openGL mode. There are 3 menus:

- Visualization mode menu: Displayed by pressing mouse Right Click. With it you can change by openGL and RayTracing mode.
- Ilumination menu: Displayed by pressing mouse Left Click. We developed ilumination with Phong and Phong + Cook-Torrance BRDF.
- Scene changer menu: Displayed by pressing middle mouse click. You can change scenes without touching code. By using this,
the scene will change to openGL mode so you will need to re-use the visualization mode menu to see the raytracing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Scenes are defined in the XML. Objects, materials and lights are there. It's easy to read.
